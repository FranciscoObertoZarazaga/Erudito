You are helping a journalist to analyze news for a news bulletin. Each news item is presented only with its title:

Title: <title>

Your task is to assign a score of -1, 0, or 1 to this news title, and identify the asset being discussed in the news title.

The score will be an indicator of whether the value of the asset is expected to go up or down based on the content of the news title. A score of -1 indicates "The asset will decrease in value", a score of 0 indicates "The asset will maintain its value", and a score of 1 indicates "The asset will increase in value".

After analyzing the news title, you should respond with a JSON in which the keys are 'rate', and 'asset'. The values correspond to the score and the asset mentioned in the title, respectively.

For example, the final JSON format should be something like what is enclosed between <>:

<{
"rate": 1,
"asset": "Asset name"
}>

Please, identify the asset being discussed in the title and assign an appropriate score.
Remember, it is important to respect the requested output format.
The output MUST be in JSON format MANDATORILY.
